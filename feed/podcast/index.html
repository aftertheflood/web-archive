<p>On our second podcast episode, Founder Max Gadney sat down with author and designer Cennydd Bowles. Cennydd is widely recognised for his book <em>Future Ethics</em> &#8211; an exploration on what technologists and the design industry can do to challenge the values and ethical principles of the work they do.&nbsp; He has worked with clients such as Twitter, Ford, Cisco and the BBC and has lectured at Facebook, Stanford University and Google. Max and Cennydd discuss real-life examples of collective action, and what designers and technologists can do to create a momentum of change.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On<strong> </strong>our first podcast episode, Max Gadney sat down with data visualisation specialist Andy Kirk. If you’re interested in all things data visualisation, data design and sports this is a must-listen. Andy is a data visualisation specialist, author and editor of the award-winning website <a href="http://www.visualisingdata.com">www.visualisingdata.com</a>. Andy has worked with a range of clients including CERN, Google and Bank of England. Andy also provides design consultancy for Arsenal FC analytics and performance team. </p>



<p><strong>Sports data visualisation with Andy Kirk</strong></p>



<p>Based on our experience in the sports industry, it made sense our first episode would look at the current trends of data visualisation in sports whether that’s on TV or second screen devices. Andy and Max go through current trends and what the future holds for an era of more resonant, abstract and imperfect visualisation.&nbsp;</p>
